# Uh Oh, Time to Roll Everything Back!



## This is the awesome part to me imagine the cases of errors and then having to do the tedious task of cleaning failed servers! There is a solution
## With automated rollback there is no need to crunch through the cloud to do manual cleanup that takes long hours not including how long it took before the teams notices the error. 
## In a ci/cd pipeline rollbacks ensure when code fail the necessary clean-up are carried out immediately. Think of it as having eyes in the future; it saves cost.

# The code in config.yml shows what a rollback would look like combined with a smoke test
